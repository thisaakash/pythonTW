2. Content:
  2.1. Bullet points: 3 per experience, closely mirroring job requirements.

  2.4. Action Verbs: Showcase soft skills with strong, active verbs.
  2.5. Honesty: Prioritize truthfulness and objective language.
  2.6. Structure: Each bullet point follows "Did X by doing Y, achieved Z" format.
